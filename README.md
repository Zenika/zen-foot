zenfoot
=============

zenfoot is a bet application for the Football World Cup

# Dependencies

Use restx forked version on [github](https://github.com/boillodmanuel/restx/)
In order to use the fork version, clone the restx fork to any directory, and use

```
 mvn -DskipTests clean install
```
The pom.xml in zenfoot project is set to correspond to that forked version.

# Deployment

Required :
-App engine SDK
-npm and node.js if you want to modify the UI significantly

Locally :
---

Download app engine SDK and add it to your PATH.

Then run 

```
mvn clean -DskipTests package
dev_appserver.sh target/zen-foot-1
```

You can run the static files with nodes (recommended), so you don't have to redeploy the whole project with GAE every
time you modify you client.

To do this, you have to install node, and then in src/main/webapp run :

If it is the first time you run it, you'll first have to run the following line to load the dependencies listed in the 
package.json :
```
npm install
```
And then every time you start deploying locally, run the following :
```
node server.js
```
The static files will be running on localhost:9000, and every call to the api will be redirected to localhost:8080. So you can
now test the app on localhost:9000

Alternatively, you can use Grunt with the provided `gruntfile.coffee` to run both the server and a watch task that reloads the browser on every client-side code file modification.
```
npm install
grunt
```

On Google App Engine (GAE) :
---

If you are contributing to zenfoot, you won't have to deploy the application to app engine, as we are functioning
with pull requests. You can see the deployed app [here](http://1-dot-zen-foot.appspot.com/)
```
mvn package
appcfg.sh --no_cookies --email=<EMAIL> update target/gae-restx-poc-0-1

```
remove --no_cookies if you want to type your PW only once.
